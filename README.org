** Usage:
 - Run =server/server.py= to start the game server.
 - Run =game/main.py= to start a game client.

** Assets:
 - Chess piece sprites: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent
 - Font: https://www.fontspace.com/pixel-sagas/roddenberry
 - Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mrNZCe4knI
  
** Notes:
 - To move a piece, you must enter a move of the form =r,f,z=, where
   =r= is a rank from 0-9, f is a file from a-z, and z is a zlevel
   from 1-7. Invalid move errors are currently displayed only in the console.
 - Due to time constraints with other projects, there is no logic in
   place to force players to play the game by the rules.
** Dependencies:
 This project requires the following python3 packages:
 - =tornado=
 - =websocket-client=
 - =numpy=
